# How do I include or exclude files from monitoring?

You can add file masks like `*.cs` into `included.txt` and `excluded.txt` files in LiveReload's app data folder.

Right-click the version number in the title bar and choose “Open App Data Folder” to quickly open the folder. The files should be already there (LiveReload creates them for you on first launch).


These files use a gitignore-like syntax and should be already there (LiveReload creates them for you on first launch).
